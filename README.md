This project implements a password manager utilizing cryptographic techniques. It enables users to store and manage their website credentials in an encrypted format. The system employs a Fernet encryption scheme to secure user passwords, ensuring data confidentiality. Additionally, the application integrates features to create, update, delete, and retrieve password entries for various websites while maintaining encryption integrity. The user's master password unlocks access to the Fernet key, allowing decryption and consultation of stored passwords.
